# Pluto Dashboard

Pluto Dashboard is using ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, and C#.NET. Even though, we are interested in the ASP.NET Core, the latest technologies for a new incoming project development, but we still need to setting up with ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC to maintain and support customers using this version.

We prefer using webpack, a modern JavaScript both of Angular and React.
